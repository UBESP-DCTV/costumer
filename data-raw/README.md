# Instructions

* Bring `raw_pubmed/` folder, `raw_ctgov.zip` and `random4h28.xlsx`
    files from where they are (possibly in the local folder
    `non_git_nor_build_derived_data` or at a shared link reported in the
    main `README` of the present package).
* Decompress here `raw_ctgov.zip` (decompressed file size is ~841 MB).
* Run the scripts for which there is some interest.

> Note: any output from the scripts in this folder is in the `data/` folder 
        or the local folder `non_git_nor_build_derived_data` or at the 
        shared link reported in the main `README` of the present package. 
        Hence, you need to run this scripts only to check or update
        those files.
